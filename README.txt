MonoTouch.Dialog is a foundation to create dialog boxes without
having to write dozens of delegates and controllers for a user
interface.

There will be two layers, one is the tree API in Element.cs and a
second layer will be map .NET classes that have been decoared with
attributes to and from this tree.

Currently only a handful of widgets have been implemented, but it
shows the overall direction of where this is going.  

The sample program merely tries to exercise the capabilities by trying
to replicate the "Settings" application on the iPhone, once that
is complete, I will add the mapping using Reflection.
