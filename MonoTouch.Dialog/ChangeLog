	* DialogViewController.cs (StartSearch, FinishSearch,
	PerformFilter): Made public these methods.   They allow consumers
	to start, stop and trigger a filter operation programatically.

	(OnSearchTextChanged): New virtual method that subclasses can hook
	up into to check for changes in the search bar.   

	(SearchTextChanged): Event to listen to changes in the search.

	(Selected): New virtual method that actually dispatches to the
	Selected method in the element.  This wasy subclasses can catch
	the Selected method without having to hook up hundreds of
	methods. 

	* Element.cs (Section.Insert): the overload that takes an
	IEnumerable now returns the number of items that were inserted. 

	(Section.Remove): Add new overload to remove an element from the
	section.

	(RootElement): New constructor that can take a function that
	creates the nested DialogViewController, this prevents code from
	having to derive a new class just to push a new kind of
	UIViewController.
